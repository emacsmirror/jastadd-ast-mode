* A JastAdd AST mode for Emacs

This mode provides light support for editing of [[http://jastadd.org/][JastAdd]] AST definition files
for the Emacs editor.  Currently, this means syntax highlighting, comment
support and navigation to definitions via imenu.

Note that this mode does not implement support for =jadd= and =jrag= files;
the Java mode(s) provided by Emacs work ok for these file types.

** Installation

Using John Wiegley's excellent [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] package:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package jastadd-ast-mode
  :load-path "~/Source/jastadd-ast-mode"
  :mode "\\.ast\\'")
#+END_SRC

(This assumes you cloned the repository at =~/Source/jastadd-ast-mode/=;
adjust to taste.)
