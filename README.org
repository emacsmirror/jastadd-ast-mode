* A JastAdd AST mode for Emacs

This mode provides light support for editing of JastAdd AST definition files
for the Emacs editor.  Currently, this means syntax highlighting, comment
support and navigation to definitions via imenu.

Note that this mode does not implement support for =jadd= and =jrag= files;
the Java mode(s) provided by Emacs work ok for these file types.
